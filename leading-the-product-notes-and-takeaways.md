## Rich Mironov - MC

Rich is a 35-year veteran of Silicon Valley tech companies. He is the author of "The Art of Product Management" (2008) and organized the first Product Camps.

### What is still the same in the past 30 years of product management?

- it's still hazily defined, and every company has a different take on it
- it is an outcome-focussed practice
- product management is like raising children - PMs want their products to grow up to be big and strong in the next 18 releases
- product managers have tremendous responsibility, but not so much authority

### What has changed in the last three decades of Product Management?

- product management is much more visible, more people have now heard of product management
- we use Agile-ish methods
- people have inflated expectations of what a product manager can/will do
- it has become a sought-after job

## Radhika Dutt

Lean startup has done a lot for product development, but it has lead to an iteration epidemic - it has become ok for compaines to start by developing a product, only discovering the vision while actively on this journey. Radhika says, that's a critical flaw for most companies.
For the few companies who have successeded with this approach, there are a graveyard of unseen companies who have failed.
"Iterate quickly". "Fail fast, learn fast"
Radhika, whith her experience of (xyz), wants to call bullshit on this.

### Common Product Diseases

1. Pivotitis: rapid, frequent changes in product direction, which leads to confused customers, and a confused product team.
2. Hypermetricemia: obession with metrics and analytics; incremental prodcut improvement based on metrics that may not be relevant (for example - do you really want to increase the return rate of patients at your hospital?)
3. Obessive Sales Disorder: trading the long game for quick gains, which leads to a fragmented product and distraceted engineers. "We can win this big deal, all you have to do is add this one custom feature". Ultimatley, you end up with a lot of contracts, and a lot of milestones not met.
4. Narcussus complex: looking inwards and focussing on our own needs, while being disconnected from customer needs.

Tradeoffs are OK from time to time, but when we keep doing these things repeatedly, we lose who we aren and we get confused about what we stand for.

#### But can't 'lean' and 'Agile' get us out of this trouble?

These are great at helping us get places quickly, but they don't help us understand which direction we're going in.

### Radical Products over Iterative Products - to avoid Disease

You're never going to create a revolutionary product by inching up or reacting to the market. Radical product thinking is the antithesis to iterative products which are susceptible to the common product diseases.

To build radical products, you need to traverse organisational siloes, and work from a shared vision with a shared language of product strategy and execution.

#### Defining a Product Vision

Forget everything we've ever learned about having a good vision. Words and phrases like "empower", "distrupt", and "be the leader" may sound heroic, but are superficial. Vision should be the compass to your product, and broad visions are not very good at giving direction. A vision needs to be detailed so that it's actually actionable. Think about:

- whose world are you changing?
- what does their world look like today?
- why does their world need changing?
- how are you going to change it for them?

#### Radical Vision Statement

Here's a template:

"Today when {identified group} want to {desireable outcome}, they have to {current activity/solutions}. This is unnaccetpable because {shortcomings of current solution}. We envision a world where {shortcomings are resolved}. We're bringing this world about through {broad technology/ approach}."

This statement is a little clunky, and perhaps not so catchy - rather, it's the 'source code' for your vision. The development team can work to it. The marketing team can take the source code and make a clean build for promotional messaging. This statement is the compass.

### What comes next?

With a solid vision statement for a product, the next steps to move through are a) strategy, b) prioritisation and c) execution and measurement. Align the team on vision and strategy before you move into iterative development.

**Takeaways:**

- Start with a vision before moving on to anything else.
- Work in this order: 1. vision 2. strategy 3. prioritisation 4. execution and measurement
- Treat your vision as a hypothesis to test and iterate against
- A vision needs to be actionable, referencing the who, what, where, when, why and how of a product
- Whatever is the change you're tring to create in the workd. your product is the vehicle.

## Sherif Mansour - The Data Driven Paradox

Product manager at Atlassian for 10 years.
Sherif has been in software development for over 15 years and a Product Manager at Atlassian for 10 years. Most recently, he spends most of his days trying to solve problems across all of Atlassian's cloud products, and also played a key role in developing new products at Atlassian such as Stride, Team Calendars, and Confluence Questions.

### How can we be 'data informed' instead of 'data driven?'

Data leads to a false sense of securiyy - think you can use it to make decisions, but really it will probably just open more quetions.

We're too data driven when it comes to setting goals. We spend too much time on data when we decide what to build next.

What should we be spending time on instead, to drive our decision making?

1. Understand what your guardrail metrics are and use those as part of your definition of success
2. Focus on solving problems rather than improving metrics
3. Align stakeholders on the vision to shift mindsets from data-driven to "data informed"

Guard

understand what your guardrail metrics are.
health metrics
level one guardrail metrics - product
level two marketing and a
levl three company - users, money coming in
each level has different stakeholders

What to do here - fake it! Get a half hour whiteboard session and draw the charts. Fake the data. Ask yourselves (or clients) "is this useful" "would I actulaly use this?>"
What's more imporatnt probably is the right questions.
Get the questions rigth first instead of worrying about having more data.

Roadmaps - building a product roadmp on a spreadsheet. IF you want to make it look fancy, put in more columns! "magical prioritization score!" put it in a two-by-two grid! The decicions are objective and obvious!
This is a false sense of security.
These work well when you're comparing apples with apples.

Persona-Lead Roadmapping
persona = architype of a user
Customer journey in phases (e.g. as a hotel - commute to hotel, check in, catch the elevator to your room etc)
Look at the opportunities for each persona within each of these phases.

Fake the results before instrumenting data
value questions over data
consider persona driven roadmpas

_Improving Features_

- What do you do with low-use feautres?
  Dont make your product awesome, make your users awesome.
  Where does your product sit in the users' mastery curve?
  E.g. iPhone - seems simple but has HEAPS of features. But as you use the product, it progressively discolves the different features.
  Are low-used features really bloatware? OR are they later in the users mastery curve?

- Are you measuring in the right context?
  Understand the context the feature was designed more

- Whats the value of the feature?
  How are you measureing the value? High use vs low use?
  How can we truly measure value? Let's move awat from 'frequency of use' - its more sophisticated than that.
  e.g. in Jira. One of the most low-used features is to deactivate a user account. Looking purely at the numbers - would you remove this feautre?
  Airbags are low-used features in cars - should we remove them?
  Usage does not equal value. If you're trying to work out t
- what did you do before you had this feautre?
- what would happen if we took this away?

**Key Takeaways**

- If one metric improves but other metrics specific to the health of your products falls down, that's not success
- Empower teams to come up with their own key objectives and key results, instead of handing them down.

## Product Managment Roles Defined with @Brainmates

Roles on a product team are often fuzzy, and every company has a different definition of what product roles are. "Product people" often includes titles such as product manager, product owner, subject matter expert, user experience, product design, rpduct operations. Even in our internal teams, we will differ in our definitions.

Product management is a teamm sport, so rather than thinking about titles, think about 'areas of responsibility'. Areas of responsibility will overlap, and together, the players act as a team.

... so what are the areas of responsility?

Key question - what product position do you play?

- ignore the titles. They don't matter! They are only useful for business cards and linkedin profiles.
  More importantly, what areas of responsibility do you cover? (Refer to the map)
  Changes are, many people on your team
- build teams of overlapping areas of responsbility.
  which ares are covered?
  Which ares have duplication?

## Bruce McCarthy - Strategy!

Too many product driven companies suffer from Shiny Object Syndrome
"quote from photo"

A good strategy is a defense against shiney object syndrome

Product vision
businsess outcomes
customer problems
cood discussion
= aligned stragegy! (aka product roadmap!)

Product vision strategy
help {type of customer} {imrpove in some way} by {what we do best}

In your goals, what are the means and what are the ends? Why do we need (the things on the left )
_means_ | _ends_
HTML5 Redeisng | Grow lifetyme value
Social integration | grow market share
customer requests | competitive barries
revenue | grow recurring revenue
scalability | fulfull more demand
transformational ideas |

3 objectives 10 key results

One: Value (PRE-PRODUCT MARKET FIT)

1. Support core value
2. barriers to competition

Two: Growth (GROWTH PHASE)

1.  improve recurring revenue
2.  grow market share
3.  fulfull more demand
4.  develop new markets

Three: Profit (MATURITY)

1. support highet prioces
2. improve lifestime value
3. leverage assets
4. lower costs

Roadmap - drive by business outcomes
Build it in a spreadsheet - make s scorecard - do the maths!

value divided by effort equals priority
value - expected contribution to business outcomes
effort - estimated time and sources to solve the problem

(v/e) \* c = priorty

(c = confidence. how confident are we that our scores are accurate? Have we done this before? Do we need more research, more valudation?)
keep the measures simple - 0, 1, 2.low, medium, high. tshirt sizes. small medium large.
BEING ABLE TO DO THE MATH IN YOUR HEAD IS THE MORT IMPORTNAT

Shuttle diplomancy, negotiate between teams.
Consensus beyond two people is impossible. Look for alignment instead.
Shuttle to stakeholders individually.
THEN have the big stakeholder meeting.

I"Ve got a draft set of priotieis. Would you help me refine it?
Can you have a 5-10 minute conversation with different team members/ staleholders?
A COLLABORATE process instead of an APPROVAL process.
"I'll present out priorities at the leadership meeting on friday"

production vision > bisiness outcomes > customer problems > good discussion = ALIGNED STRATEGY

## Ana Rowe - Growth Hacking

What is growth hacking? Is it just a bunch of tricks?

When an organisation or a team puts everything they have into driving growth, and all priorities go towards growth, that is what Ana defines as Growth Hacking. IMportantnly, it needs to come from strategy, vision and objectives. You need to know your customers and know what you're doing.

1. Goals and Metrics must be insiring

- does it motivate you?-
  is it challenging ?
- does it feel like a win?

What is an inspiring metric?
Does it motivate you to work towards?

2. You cant grow fast if there is no product market fit
   you can't do grwoth hacking until you have figured out your business model.

3. shooting for the roof is as exciting as shooting for the moon

4. Learning is more important than winning

5. If it's uncomforatble, you're probably on the right track
   e.g. if your goal is to grow over making money, why not try making some of your paid products free??

So... should you be growth hacking?

Don't growth hack if....

- don't hack if you can't prioritise growht
- dont hack if you are looking for a magic fix
- don't hack if there is no product-market fit
- don't hack if it's difficult to cereate a lean cross-functional team

DO growth hack if...

- do hack if you need to ignite growht
- do hack if you are low on resources
- do hack if your team is good at challenging everything
- do hack if the business has the growth and risk-taking mindset

## Audrey Cheng - Product Management and UX Design - Embrace the Tension Between Us

What is the role of UX Design? Is it the department of crayons, the colouring in department? Does it get confused for the UI design? Do UX designers only care about the imact on users's lives?

What is the role of Product Manager? Is it the department of "No"? Do Product Managers only care about creation of value for the business?

Audrey Cheng wants to challenge our assumptions on this, and help to break down frictions. SHe says, the "overlap is where the magic happens".

**How can we break down frictions between teams?**

- get comfortable in the shared context space - we don't need to define the line. We need to embrace the tension and get comfortable in that space -the magic wil happen in the middle. Needs transparency and trust. Be focussed on shared outcomes.
- nurture the relationship. Every relathionship takes work. Strong relationships are built in transoarenty and trust. Build a common understanding, make working togheter the norm, share success and failture.
- take action - build empathy, experiment and iterate, share stories (successes and failutres)

Removing friction between product managers and UX designers.
Getting comfortable in the shared space
Nurture the relationships
Take action together!

# Tom Crouch

A lightening talk from Tom Crouch takes us through some ideas to innovate in the corporate world.

Innovation in the corporate world can be challenging. Initiatives often require significant business cases, lengthy approval processes and yearly plans.

Thinking fast and getting things done
learn what drives other departments - new sales?
Do you have a call centre? they can mnauly fill in technical gaps.

repurpose existing products to test new ideas

Use customers
make friends with call centres
manual steps to fill gaps
use small trials to proof concept for investment

Takeaway - find ways to LEARN FAST and INNOVATE EARLY

# Dr Liron Nehmadi

how I wrote off 1.5million dollars in one project

spent 6 momths developing a new shiny website only to roll back to the old webiste seven days later (because the company was losing money)

WHAT WEBT WRONG
"create an amazing website" is not a project brief. Instead - what is the bsuiness problem you are tring to solve? what is the value you should delive?
What are the KPIs/ key metrics?

revolition vs evolution.
Evolution - small changes based on research and analysis in a quick timeframe. Test the concetp and then iterate, don't develop product in a silo.

RElease approach. The released back end and front end changes at the same time. Makes problems really hard to identify.

# Kent Weathers

The story of The Juicero
wifi connected
Tech company, hardware company, organic food company, subscription devliery company
118.5 million in investment!

Units - cost to produce $750. Sale price  =  $699 for the hardware/ juicer

Spent 2 years and 118mil buylding the perfect juicer. Beuacuiful, apple like hardware and machine finish.
What they should have done is sped \$10 million and work within contrsints of WHAT CUSTOMER CAN AFFORD

Bloomberg expposed them - the subscription juice packets DIDNT EVEN NEED the hardware to actuakky work. You could just squeeze them.

compared to Elon Musk TEsla Model 3 launch

Prod strategt
low volume, high price sportscar
roadster

then took that model
then, high volume high price

high volume, affordable = model three

model three launch day - 276000 in first 36 hours.
Single biggest product launch in history - 14 billion in launch week.

@steven Haines
LAUNCH PLAN (photos9)

1.  Product summary
2.  Go0to-market strategy

Confirm the market window
when is it and why?
Is it arbitrary - e.g. when we are completeing a development cycle? or tied to a date, like a conference?

Tasks

Review market and beta tests
Provide adequate sales training
align sales goals and compensation (so sales people are incetivied)
marketing and sales collateral. website and promotions ready
industry coverage arranged
distribution channels are ready - customers can purchase
Ops are ready - e.g. fulfilmment
laucnh mettrics ready
Go/ No-Go Decision
Announce to the market

which resource is doing each of the above tasks?
What are the milestones?

Types of launches

- soft launch
- full scale launch
- existing market launch - you have to carve market share away from other people. Flashy event, PR, marketing, trade shows, sales team on the road
- new market - content marketing,

Post Luanch

1. Launch audit. Did you hit the market window? Why/why nogt? what was the variance? did you acheive launch metrics? A retrospective so that you do better on the next launch.
2. Execute marekting plan
3. Run the product like a business.

aS PRODUCT MANAGERS, YOUR JOB IS TO SOLVE A REAL RPDICBLEM
in a product that customers love
in a way that provuides value to the business

# Sally Foote - There's a Problem in the Bagging Area - Your customers hate your AI and what to do about it

How can product managers get to the root of the customer problem they are trying to solve?

People are not calling up call centres thinking "ooh I really want to speak to a robot". No. they want to speak to a human.

Your customers hate your AI!

the bagging area sentence is not very friendly.
"unexpected item in the bagging area"

"humans have rules that govern how we interact with eachter. These also apply to technoloy"

We need to teach our AI some manners!!

Debrettes - book of manners

- if you do not hve an invitation, do not go to the party!
  Humans use emotions to make decisions. AI cannot learn emotions.
  E.g. photo books. User average 76 mins to select photos. AI could help here! User ML to choose the most aesthetic photos. But the most aesthetic photos are necessarily the important photos. That's an emotiomnal choisce.
- No one likes to be left out.
  e.g betty crocker cake mix. When sales declined, they removed the dried eggs and made users add their own eggs. SO they actually felt like they were baking.
  You can't let AI do everthing. In the photobooks, the user has to feel like they made it. It needs to be special, handmade, unique. Needs the human input.
  There's a lot that AI can do - but it shouldn't do everything. "humans don't want to be written out of the equasion".
  Great AI implementation augments customer experience.
- Humans want to feel in control.
  They want to be involved in the decision making process - for the outcome that effects them.
  E.g. AI to build a photobook that ends up being too long and too expensive for the custoemrs
  Remind custoemrs that they can make changes all the way through. Provide language queues and tags that remind people that they are constantly in control
- AI cannot be a know it all! Even if you are an expert in a matter, it is not polite to expound on it ceaselessly!!
- IF one shoudl accidentlaly create a mess, one should immediately and gracefully clean it up!
  if you do not get it right, you will be back to square one trying to regain people's trust.
  When AI really works, no one should notice.
- no one should be obliged to talk to you - ensure listeners can leave your converstaion without embarrasment!
  how do people opt-out of an AI driven/automated experience?

The rules are the same
really understand the customer problems youre solving, and put the customer in control - at the heart of the exprerience.

Don't use AI just to tick a box to say you're going to implememnt fancy new tech.
The specific solution (e.g. AI) doesn't matter. WHat matters is that the problem gets solved.

# Sharon Anne Kean - the Ultimate Road trip:

Why Product Leadership?

When you have 'product thinking' in an organisation, you put the customer at the heart of everything you are doing, and you change behaviours because of that. Think Uber Eats and Deliveroo - they way we order food now is completely different to how we ordered food ten years ago.

What is a product leader?
Someone who leads and manages product managers.

WHat stops product managers from becoming great product leaders?

- it's very busy. You're in the middle of a venn diagram. tech, UX, business. Distracted by Shiny product syndrome.

What do product leaders actually do?
The difference between product manager and product leader

1. metrics
2. people

the way you treat them and use them becomes differne.t

Metrics are company wide rather than product specific.
PL - Csuits, stragely and vision, customer value, busness value
PM - team, deliver,y single team, product, customer value

User story
as a {user type} I want to {do something} so that {outcome} and I'll knwo that it's successful if {metric}

As a product leader, people and organsation are your products.

Product leaer (roadtrip metaphor below)

1. Are you memorable? What do you want to be known for? Personal brand and visibility? What does your organisation look for in its leaders?
2. Practice being visible - Company wide initiatives, interla talks, mentoring junior team members, sepeaking at conferences, do you have a seat at the table?
3. Keep going - once is not enough. Breathe life into your career. Ask for feedback and be popen to receing it, grow your reach and your network, get advice from your manager, talk to other pms and laeders, gather experience o the journey, anre you enjoying the journey?
4. Choose a good route - are you getting there fast or slow? what's the journey and how important are various aspects of it? do you go direct or do you meander? What's the vehicle?

What do product leaders do>
Create greate delivery systmes (structure and gocnrance)
buildin strong teams (hiring and performance managment)
help set a direction (product vision)
maintain that direction (stakholder managment)

How do you do these four things at once?

- keep being an awesome product manager - but be mindful of your time and where you invest it

Roardtrup metaphor
Have a car
Start driving
Add fuel
Have a good route

The world needs more great product leaders.
There's room for all sorts of backgrounds here, but we need more people with solid product management experience moving into leadership roles.

# John Zeratsky - how to solve big problems and test new ideas

Coming up with ideas is easy. Product managers have hundreds of ideas, coming in from customers, ideas for improvements, ideas from internal stakeholders.

Some ideas are amazing. Some ideas are ... meh. Some ideas are dangerous: they could cause you to lose customers, and waste time and money.

So how do you differentiate between a good, a meh and a dangerous idea?

Typically when evaluating an idea, teams do some sort of analysis, perform market research, and have internal debates. "Lets bang out a quick MVP" is a common phrase. But building things take waaay longer than you think. "Let's knock something up in two weeks"... cut to two months later....

## Using Design Sprints

A conventional design process John has come across in his career (working at print newspapers, in ditial products, and on massive digital platforms) is as follows: goals - ideas - argue - build - ship - test. To learn, you need to fail and get feedback. In this conventional design process, the feedback only happens at the very end. So it makes sense that more reps = more feedback = more learning = more success. This works for print newspapers that have hard deadlines. It doesn't work so well for digital products and platforms that are full of unknowns.

**Instead, John recommends the five-day design sprint process to test and verify ideas.**

The design sprint process replaces the conventional process with the following phases: map - sketch - decide - prototype - test. These phases happen Monday through Friday of one week, with full focus.

### Map - Monday

Monday - create a MAP of the project we're working on.
find a key moment - the greatest RISK or greated OPPORTUNITY> This is the target, the focus for the rest of the week.

### Sketch - Tuesday

group brainstorming produces lower queliaty ideas.
People work alone, toghether in a room. Creating detailed sketches around that moment.
This levels the playing field. Creates healthy competition, doesn't rely on people being louder in a group.

### Decide - Wednesday

fast & decivice exercises.

1. silent voting
2. structured critique - everyone talks
3. decision maker (a person) makes the call

### Build a prototype - Thursday

build a facade of the finished product. Split up the work. Make something that looks real but isn't complete or really functional.
Or a fake app
IT SHOULD LOOK REALISTIC
fake the marketing! start with the marketing, the packaging, the sales deck, the sales website.
Fake some services -

### Test - Friday

don't wait to gather perfect data. get some quick and dirty data.
1:1 customer interviews. Walk through a prototpye with a customer.
While the interviews are going on in one room, the rest of the team are in another room KEEPING SCORE
this is time travel

## Should you do a design sprint?

what makes a project a good candidate for a design sprint?
the best sprint priejts are tough to executre on with uncertain outcomes
high level of difficult to actually build it and no idea as to wheterh it would be well received by customers.

The design sprint process is great for the beginning of new initiatives and new projects. SAves time upfront. Yoou're not executuing on ideas that will be unsuccessfuly. You can also take more risks - ypu are only failing in front of five customers, not failing in the market. You also get to work with people into a different way, not runnign from email and meetings etc.

They provide a recpe to spend time on the work that really matters.

(can we do this )with such cliche over a weekend?

In the enterprise world, how do you recruit people to participate in user interviews?

---

Major Takeaways

- start with vision, always
- product is not an island - you can map product roles on a canvas, external to internal on the x axis, strategic to tactical on the y access, with roles as intersecting areas across these axes.
